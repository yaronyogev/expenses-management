- Python
- ExtJS
- MVC
- Git & GitHub

Current State

In development, still not doing anything useful.

Program Purpose
---------------
Personal finance management:
- Track expenses
- Create & modify budget
- Compare expenses vs. budget

Program History
---------------
I have been tracking my personal & family expenses ever since I moved
out of my parents house in 1994. At first I used Excell, but I quicky realized
this was very inconvenient as I needed better UI, namely an input form.
I therefore wrote an MS Access application for doing that, starting in Access 1.0
and upgrading all the way to MS Access 2013 & 365. Along the way I gave my app to
people who needed it, including families in financial crisis that had helped in
my volunteering work in the Paamonim organization.
After a couple of times where I encountered people who just did not have the money for
buying MS Office Pro to have MS Access, I understood this called for a web-based
app. I also wanted to have my expenses tracking easily accessible from my mobile,
although I'm still a long way from getting there.
